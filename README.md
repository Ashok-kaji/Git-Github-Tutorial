# Git & Github Tutorial 
Here you will find a complete step-by-step guide to using Git & Github.

# Most Important point to keep in mind:-
1. git pull origin main:- When you commit any change in GitHub/remote repository and want to have that commit in the local repository.
2. git push origin main:- When you commit any change in the local repository and want to have that commit in the remote repository.
3. git pull origin main --no-rebase :- When you made commits in the remote repo and local repo independently, then run this command to merge both commits, in vs code terminal.
4. 4. If you encounter any merge conflicts then manually correct them and then commit the changes and push them to the remote repository.
